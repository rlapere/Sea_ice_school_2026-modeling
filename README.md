# Sea_ice_school_2026-modeling
Here we elaborate and store the tutorials on modeling for the Saroma sea ice school 2026. Three different Jupyter notebooks are made available to the students, with a Binder laucher to run the notebooks.

Three different notebooks are included here:
- [general.ipynb]("general.ipynb") contains basic examples and tips for climate data retrieval and plotting.
- [beginners.ipynb]("beginners.ipynb") is designed for students with less experience in coding and/or notebooks
- [statistical_analysis.ipynb]("statistical_analysis.ipynb") contains examples of typical statistical analysis useful for climate data
